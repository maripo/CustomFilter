	<h1>How "Search Region" property works</h1>
	<p>
		This XPath expression specifies in which elements this extension search for keywords.
		If some of specified elements contain keyword and the elements are contained by "Elements to Hide", the rule works and "Elements to Hide" will be hidden.

	<p>
		You can get XPaths easily by clicking "Suggest" and click one of target elements.
		Some XPaths which can select similar elements are suggested.

	<p>
		When "Block Anyway" is checked this property is useless because elements selected by XPath of "Elements to Hide" will be hidden, whether keywords are contained or not.
