      li Block tweets posted by specific apps on twitter
      li Block comments which contain unpleasant words or tags on social bookmark sites
      li Remove results on specific domains from Google search results

      li Click "New Rule for this Site"
      li Edit site RegEx if necessary
      li Click "Get XPath" button and select XPath which hits desired elements
      li Input some keywords
      li Save the rule and reload the page
    p

    h2 What is XPath?
    p
      strong XPath
      |  is a language for selecting nodes from XML documents.
      | 			It works well for picking elements from web pages written in HTML.
    p
      | If you are not familiar with XPath, this extension helps you to get proper XPath and select specific elements as intended.
      | Click "Get XPath" button and select one of target elements.
      | Some XPath expressions are suggested.
    p
      img(src='../img/help/help3.png')
    p
      | When the mouse cursor is over one of suggested XPaths, elements selected by it are highlighted.
      | Click an option which meets intended elements and you can use the selection when the rule is applied.
    p
      | Of course, you can write XPath manually.

    h2 What does the "RegEx" checkbox on the right hand of the keyword textbox?
    p
      | There are two type of keywords, "Simple Match" and "Regular Expression".
      | The rule works when the content of an element contains simply "Simple Match" keywords or match "Regular Expression" keyword.
      | Keywords which are input when "RegEx" checkbox is checked, they work as "Regular Expression".
    h2 I want hide some elements whether they contain any keyword or not.
    p
      | When "Block Anyway" is checked, elements selected by XPath of "Elements to Hide" will be hidden, whether keywords are contained or not.
